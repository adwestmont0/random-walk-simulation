# random-walk-simulation
Python program for random walk simulation


I developed a Python simulation to study random walks and analyze how randomness behaves over time. Each simulation modeled a one-dimensional random walk where the position changed by ±1 at each step with equal probability. While individual paths appeared unpredictable, running hundreds of trials revealed consistent statistical patterns. The mean final position remained close to zero, demonstrating symmetry, while the distribution of final positions spread out as the number of steps increased. I visualized these results using matplotlib, including line plots and histograms. This project helped me understand how probability theory and computational modeling can reveal order within randomness.

Increasing the number of steps increased the spread of final positions but not the mean.
